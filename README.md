# Connectivity

This repository contains code for automatic detection of berms and stockponds, and figures accompanying the paper {\em Automated earthwork detection using topological
persistence}, by Dana A Lapides, Gillian Grindstaff, and Mary H Nichols. 
* Berms
* Synthetics: csv files with elevation data for simple example landscapes
    * example 1: flat slope
    * example 2: slope with random noise
    * example 3: slope with a straight channel
    * example 4: slope with a branched channel
    * example 5: square pit
    * example 6: slope with contour berm
